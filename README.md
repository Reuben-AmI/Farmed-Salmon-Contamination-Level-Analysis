# Farmed Salmon Contamination Level R Analysis

### In this project we investigate contamination levels in farm raised salmon. The obtained data set consists of 153 instances of farm raised salmon. It includes salmons’ farms origin and 11 different contaminants found in salmon. We can split our data into three regions: North America, South America and Europe. In this research we would like to focus on which region of farm salmon has a higher mean Mirex contaminant. Additionally we are interested to see if some contaminants are independent from other contaminants in their respective levels. To address these questions, we will use statistical methods like ANOVA(analysis of variance), permutation based ANOVA and permutation test of independence of two variables.
