# Farmed Salmon Contamination Level R Analysis

### In this project we investigate contamination levels in farm raised salmon. The obtained data set consists of 153 instances of farm raised salmon. It includes salmons’ farms origin and 11 different contaminants found in salmon. We can split our data into three regions: North America, South America and Europe. In this research we would like to focus on which region of farm salmon has a higher mean Mirex contaminant. Additionally we are interested to see if some contaminants are independent from other contaminants in their respective levels. To address these questions, we will use statistical methods like ANOVA(analysis of variance), permutation based ANOVA and permutation test of independence of two variables. There are papers that also focused salmon contamination levels. For example, ‘Global Assessment of Organic Contaminants in Farmed Salmon. (2003)’. However, above mentioned paper and others were focusing on mean contamination locations in particular locations rather than by regions. Additionally, none of them focused on any form of correlation between contaminants.
